              sequencing (ATAC-seq), based on direct in vitro transposition of
              sequencing adaptors into native chromatin, as a rapid and
              sensitive method for integrative epigenomic analysis. ATAC-seq
              captures open chromatin sites using a simple two-step protocol
              with 500-50,000 cells and reveals the interplay between genomic
              locations of open chromatin, DNA-binding proteins, individual
              nucleosomes and chromatin compaction at nucleotide resolution. We
              discovered classes of DNA-binding factors that strictly avoided,
              could tolerate or tended to overlap with nucleosomes. Using
              ATAC-seq maps of human CD4(+) T cells from a proband obtained on
              consecutive days, we demonstrated the feasibility of analyzing an
              individual's epigenome on a timescale compatible with clinical
              decision-making.",

  abstract      = "Summary: BWA-MEM is a new alignment algorithm for aligning
                   sequence reads or long query sequences against a large
                   reference genome such as human. It automatically chooses
                   between local and end-to-end alignments, supports paired-end
                   reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is
                   robust to sequencing errors and applicable to a wide range
                   of sequence lengths from 70bp to a few megabases. For
                   mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better performance
                   than several state-of-art read aligners to date.
                   Availability and implementation: BWA-MEM is implemented as a
                   component of BWA, which is available at
                   http://github.com/lh3/bwa. Contact:
